- Tutorial incomplete
- User cannot delete nor modify panels
- Status bar flickers when passing through activities (very subtle)
- Read controllers don't start when newly created (simply call controllerViewManager.startController())




Completed

- AlertDialogs in 'ControllersActivity' and 'MainActivity' are different
- Home button animation (ripple effect) in the toolbar only works eventually
- ControllerActivity second time opening doesn't react to listener
- When finishing the tutorial, a new MainActivity instance is created on top of the previous one
